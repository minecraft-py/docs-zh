# Documentation
This is the offical documentation of Minecraft in python.

Minecraft in python, abbreviation `mcpy`, is a Minecraft-like game, it's written in 100% pure python.

Not today, not tomorrow, this game will never be finished. Today we celebrate our first alpha release,
the start of a long list of new alpha releases has begun with Minecraft v0.3.2-alpha.
It's to be expected that a video game like this always eager authors who want their creation to be up to date,
usable, bug-free, adapted to multiple platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows)extensible, 
editable (under GPLv3), ready to be for those who are learning to program, 
accessible in many aspects. Decided to give up the idea of creating
an application and then leave it or just maintain it.

Minecraft-in-python will be up to date to offer fun, safe, reliable, pytonic and enjoyable
hours of gameplay for anyone. 
What we offer you is a dream, the dream of seeing an open-source game written in python with
simple rules for users to adapt easily, extensible so that you can add features that its authors
couldn't even imagine (too hard, you couldn't do such a thing, we have the imagination
to give away to a bottomless/infinite hole), based on middle age fantacy tales,  for people of 10+ years,
adaptable to the user's computer, multiplatform, multiplayer, with support for different languages, you
know internally modifiable and open in its development for those who want to support it. That's all, almost
nothing, we would like to offer you more but... You decide what you want to play today.
