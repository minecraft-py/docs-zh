# Game launcher
The launcher is an app that will allow many things like download, install and
manage different versions of the game, for now it only handles the management of the worlds.
It's complicated to make it do all your tasks, if the game doesn't have its first stable
version yet. Because of this we will focus more on the game itself and then we will make a
good launcher that will do the job.

One important thing about the launcher, it will serve as a communication between you and us
so that you can see new updates to the game and send us bug reports. 

## Download
You can download the launcher(source code) from [here](https://github.com/Minecraft-in-python/launcher).

## Changes
The launcher can change over time and even extraordinarily.
I remember what it looked like before, it's changed a bit, but it's not the same.
In the future it won't remember what it *was* today, but every change it
makes will be for the better in quality and style.
